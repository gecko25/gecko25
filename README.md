### Hello 👋

My name is Sara and I am a front end developer. 

🦀  I grew up in Maryland, spent a lot of time in Central America, now I live in a beach town in New York.

🌴 I love surfing, snowboarding & live music. 

👩‍💻  I currently work for tablethotels.com and outside of work I like hacking on my music app.

✍️  I'm currently learning typescript, tailwindcss, and I'd like to checkout remix soon.
